# behaviour_and_disease_SIS_model

Code for the behaviour and disease SIS model with complex social contagion



## How to use this repo

* Run bifurcation_plot.m to create the two-parameter bifurcation diagrams for the behaviour-dependent transmission version of the model (Figure 1).
* Run main.m to create the phase plane and time series plots for the transmission-modulated and behaviour-modulated versionfs of the model (Figures 2-4).


Figures will be saved in the `figures/` folder.
